Introduction to Workshop
========================

This workshop is designed to provide hands-on experience with ROS2 Navigation (Nav2) using the TurtleBot4 platform.

We have 5 TurtleBot4 robots available for practical exercises.

On top of letting the robot drive around we will also look into tooling other than RViz, namely the **Lichtblick Suite** for robot visualization and interaction.

This is especially useful when working with the real robots and restriction and problems manily to middleware related issues.

At NODE Robotics we were facing challenges especially with CycloneDDS and real hardware communication.

Therefore Lichtblick Suitee provides a suitable alternative for monitoring and evaluating live robot data.

The turtlebot4s are running ROS2 Jazzy with CycloneDDS as middleware.

The workshop uses latest Nav2 features available in ROS2 Kilted. Therefore we will connect the base system with navigation running in docker containers.
